I applied my skills in full-stack development, machine learning, and cloud technologies to build a robust Tenant Screening Application. The goal of the project was to streamline the tenant screening process for landlords and property managers, helping them make informed decisions based on comprehensive tenant profiles.

For the frontend, I used HTML5, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript to design a responsive user interface that allows landlords to interact seamlessly with tenant data. The interface needed to be user-friendly, especially for landlords who may not be tech-savvy, so I focused on creating intuitive navigation and form layouts.

On the backend, I leveraged Flask and Python to handle server-side logic, processing tenant applications and integrating with third-party services for verification of sensitive data like Aadhar, PAN, and income proof. I ensured secure data storage and compliance with privacy standards by encrypting sensitive information.

For the machine learning component, I used MLFlow to experiment with different models for evaluating tenant risk, based on their credit scores, rental history, and other financial data. This allowed me to automate the assessment of tenant reliability, providing landlords with actionable insights to make better leasing decisions.

I used MySQL for the database, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of tenant data. For version control and collaboration, I relied on Git and GitHub, maintaining two branches: a development branch for testing new features and a main branch for stable releases.

Finally, I applied CI/CD principles using Jenkins, automating the testing and deployment processes. I also containerized the application using Docker, ensuring that it ran consistently across different environments, and hosted it on AWS for scalability and reliability.

By combining my skills in development, machine learning, and cloud computing, I successfully built a comprehensive tenant screening system that improves decision-making and reduces risks for landlords.
